                <p id="cstudy-intro"> Being a loyal customer of Ramen Bar - a local Japanese restaurant in University 
                    City, Philadelphia - I still get annoyed by some of their website’s design problems. I doubt 
                    some other customers may have the same frustration as me, which negatively affects their 
                    experience with the restaurant no matter how amazing their foods are. As a designer who desires 
                    to create solutions for people’s problems, I decided to redesign Ramen Bar’s website with the 
                    aim to improve their customers’ experience. </p>

                <div id="ramen-wrapper1">
                    <div>
                        <p> I firstly set up a detailed plan and gathered foundational information needed to guide me 
                            throughout the project. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>User Persona & Main User Tasks: These two tasks were accomplished based on my own 
                                experience as a customer and interviews with other people around me who can be the 
                                target audience of the restaurant. Defining the activities users perform the most on 
                                this website gave me an idea of the site’s most important functions - what I needed to 
                                concentrate my design on.
                            </li>
                            <li> Analysis of the original website: Despite owning a strong color palette for branding, the 
                                website is often seen as a dry and monotonous visual evidence of the restaurant, as the 
                                text overpower visual elements and few beneficial functions to satisfy the customers’ 
                                needs. Therefore, I planned to develop on its existing palette and refine the layout in 
                                the redesign version. I also evaluated how the original website works on different device 
                                screens to identify potential problems with responsiveness.</li>
                            <li> Project goals: As a result of my analysis and research, I listed out the redesign goals. 
                                These goals were carefully deliberated to fit the target audience’s demands and solve the 
                                existing problems of the website.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 2. Information Architecture and Research: Listen to the Users </h2>
                <p> I came up with every kind of content that can and should be on the restaurant’s website, 
                    then created a card sorting exercise for six people representing the target audience to 
                    complete. Curious about different people’s perspectives, I had a short interview with each 
                    person after the exercise to investigate what kind of content they expect to see on the site, 
                    the reasoning on their way of categorizing information. Their answers gave me some interesting 
                    insights as they could be different from my perspective, even though all of us were the target 
                    audience. I carried out a data analysis of the exercise and laid out a site map demonstrating 
                    the most suitable hierarchy that helps users navigate the website.</p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 3. Wireframing: Preliminary but Thoughtful Ideas </h2>
                <p> This is my favorite part of the project, in which I searched for inspiration, brainstormed 
                    ideas, and explored every potential layout and style for the site. In the first half of the 
                    project in which I focused on designing for the desktop, I worked on the three most important 
                    pages: homepage, menu page, and contact page. I sketched out multiple wireframes for each 
                    page while keeping the research results in mind: how to arrange the information based on 
                    users’ expectations while still highlighting the restaurant’s features. In the end, I asked 
                    several potential users for feedback then finalized one wireframe for each page. I also 
                    created a new color scheme for the site, inspired by the image of sushi.</p>
                <p> Moving to tablet and mobile screens, I decided to design pages for food ordering task as well, 
                    since it was also one of the main user tasks. Relying on the desktop wireframes, I deliberated 
                    on the arrangement of the elements and how they should be shifted between screens so that they 
                    look good and work well on different devices but are still consistent. Next, I asked some 
                    people to do the paper prototype, and refined the sketches according to their feedback.</p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 4. UI Design: Accessibility and Consistency </h2>
                <p> Firstly, I gathered resources for the design: typography, iconography, images, and components. 
                    I stuck to the restaurant’s elegant and minimalistic style as a guideline in this process. 
                    Accessibility was another important factor I paid attention to: the text should be big and 
                    clear enough, highlighted pieces of information should stand out from the others, there should 
                    be color contrast, and so on. I embarked on applying these resources to the site and creating 
                    transition prototypes. For tablet and mobile screens, there are more things that I need to 
                    take into consideration: whether a button is large enough for a person’s finger to tap, 
                    proper arrangement of components and device’s keyboard (when it pulls up) so that they 
                    don’t overlap, for example. Consistency between devices was my struggle at first, as I was 
                    so into creativity and tried out different designs. The whole process was trial and error. 
                    I kept designing, having the prototype tested and commented by others, then designing again. 
                    Despite being stressed and frustrated at some point, I learned lessons and got to refine my 
                    design as I kept going.</p>

            <p id="cstudy-outro"> The end result of the project is the site’s most important pages on 
                three devices, showing considerable improvement in the design and flexibility in transition 
                between distinct screen sizes. The whole process also helped enhance my design skills and 
                confidence in UI design. Getting multiple positive and constructive opinions from people, the
