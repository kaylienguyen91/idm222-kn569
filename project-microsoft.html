                <!-- <p> Despite being created for students, the platform wasn’t the easiest to use from their perspective. </p> -->
                <p> I conducted a <strong> survey with 130+ college students</strong> to understand their background 
                    and needs, then analyzed <strong> Net Promoter Score (NPS) and comments from 1000+ users</strong> 
                    on Azure for Students to learn about their experience, pain points, and expectations. </p>
                <p> Students often encountered two main problems on the platform.</p>

                <p> To make the platform easier to scan through, I decided to <strong> focus on redesigning the navigation bar and Overview page (homepage),</strong> since the first page users see after logging into their account often determines how 
                    they navigate the rest of the platform.</p>
                <p> Some key pain points of the original designs are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Overwhelming amount of content </li>
                    <li> Unclear content structure </li>

                <!-- <p> I conducted <strong> card sorting exercises with 5 student users </strong>to learn 
                    how they’d like to organize and label the content, then created a new version of the navigation bar. </p> -->

                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 1. Put myself into users’ shoes</h3>
                <p>To solve complex problems of the app, I had to work closely with the users, and even build a relationship with them. User research is not only setting up an interview with people, but also <strong>“visiting” them and observing their frustrations in real life.</strong></p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 2. Evaluate my design decisions from multiple perspectives</h3>
                <p> Every time testing my designs with the workers, I also handed them off to stakeholders and developers. They would let me know if the design was codable or if it might cause any problem.</p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 3. Take the initiative and Learn along the way</h3>
                <p> I was nervous to know that another intern and I would be the only designers of the company. I read more books, consulted other UX professionals, and self-studied to gain confidence. Thus I soon worked my way out and took control of the project.</p>                </p>
