                <!-- <p> Despite being created for students, the platform wasn’t the easiest to use from their perspective. </p> -->
                <p> I conducted a <strong> survey with 130+ college students</strong> to understand their background 
                    and needs, then analyzed <strong> Net Promoter Score (NPS) and comments from 1000+ users</strong> 
                    on Azure for Students to learn about their experience, pain points, and expectations. </p>
                <p> Students often encountered two main problems on the platform.</p>

                    <p> To make the platform easier to scan through, I decided to <strong> focus on redesigning the navigation bar and Overview page (homepage),</strong> since the first page users see after logging into their account often determines how

                        <h3> 1. Balancing user goals and business goals </h3>
                        <p> This was the <strong> most challenging</strong> part of my project. However, it was also 
                            a perfect opportunity for me to learn how to <strong> communicate effectively</strong> 
                            with cross-functional stakeholders and users, and to go the extra mile by <strong> 
                            conducting additional research and usability testing</strong> to support my design. </p>

                        <h3> 2. Leverage AI to solve user problems </h3>
                        <p> I had a great time (and also the first time!) designing an AI-powered feature for my product, especially when I decided to think outside the box and explore ways to <strong> implement Copilot beyond just a chatbot.</strong> </p>

                        <h3> 3. Design is an evolving process </h3>
                        <p> Juggling multiple user/business requirements, I felt the pressure to finalize a design that could satisfy everyone. However, design is an iterative process, and there’s not really a “final” design. What I delivered was the best possible within the internship's time constraints, and <strong> there'll always be room for improvement.</strong> </p>
                        <p> So, <strong><em> keep learning and moving forward!</em></strong> </p>
