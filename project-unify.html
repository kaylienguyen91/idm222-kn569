                <p id="cstudy-intro"> Being in Philadelphia, a big city with a large community of college students, 
                    many students, including me and my two teammates, find it hard to find and connect with those 
                    sharing the same personality and interests as them, as well as nurturing their relationships. 
                    Identifying this problem, our team kicked off this project with the aim to design a solution 
                    for it using a wearable and a digital product. <br>
                    Each team member participated in every stage of the project but also focused on one or two 
                    specific tasks. My concentration was research and UI design of the mobile application. </p>

                <div id="unify-wrapper1">
                    <p> After dividing the project into stages, we built a timeline for project management. Based on 
                        the general problem we wanted to solve, we narrowed it down to focused research questions such 
                        as “How might we bring students together in such a large city?”, “How might we help students 
                        expand their social network while maintaining existing relationships simultaneously?” These 
                        questions represented the goals we wanted to achieve after the project. Next, we determined 
                        our tangible and digital products to be a bracelet and a mobile app, which students can have 
                        with them almost all the time. </p>

                <div id="unify-wrapper2">
                    <p> We did both primary and secondary research on the target users and the problem. To get started, 
                        we came up with some questions we were seeking for answers from the users and conducted a 
                        Google Form survey. In addition, we searched for articles and videos about our topic to see 
                        how others had addressed and dealt with the problem before.</p>

                        behaviors, the specific problems they were facing, which and how external factors intensified 
                        these problems, as well as what they desire to change.</p>

                <p> This is one of the two most important phases in our project. According to our research results, 
                    we brainstormed some features and functions that our wearable and digital products should have 
                    to solve the users’ problem, and how the two can connect with one another to maximize the 
                    users’ experience. We also relied on our past experience with similar products and put 
                    ourselves in the users’ shoes to come up with ideas. Each idea was sketched on a large piece 
                    of paper with a rough drawing of the product’s design, notes about its function and a 
                    storyboard showing how people use it.</p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 5. Final Solution </h2>
                <p> Gathering around 3 ideas from each team member, we then discussed each one’s potentials and 
                    asked around 30 students on the campus for feedback. We decided to incorporate the design from 
                    one idea and the app functions from some others to figure out the most promising solution. A 
                    prototype of the bracelet was next created using paper and other crafting materials, and the 
                    app interface was designed on Figma to demonstrate the digital product’s features. These two 
                    tasks were for the user testing and product presentation. Lastly, we built a marketing plan 
                    for the products supposing that they would be brought into real life.</p>

            <p id="cstudy-outro"> Although the end result of this five-week project only stopped at the solution 
                and prototype (no real bracelet and app were developed), we got a lot of positive feedback from 
                professors in the Product Design department and other students for the potential of the products. 
                The project acts as a motivation for us to improve our research and design skills, and be ready 
                for more advanced projects in the time ahead.</p>
