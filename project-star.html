                <p id="cstudy-intro"> The STAR (Students Tackling Advanced Research) Program marks some 
                        of my memorable first-times: my first job and my first academic research. This program of 
                        Pennoni Honors College, Drexel University, is an opportunity for first-year students to 
                        engage in an early faculty-mentored undergraduate research over the summer. I collaborated with two faculty professors to study how teenagers support each other on Instagram Direct 
                        Messaging with the main role in <strong>directly coding and analyzing the provided data</strong>. Our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581233" target="_blank">research paper</a> 
                        got accepted to be published at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 
                        in April, 2023. This research was also the groundwork for our current study on youth’s norms and
                        perspectives on effective peer mentoring (from September 2022 to the present). </p>

                <div id="star-wrapper1">
                    <div>
                        <p> Despite enjoying working with real data and information more than reading research 
                            papers, I still found myself gaining a lot of insights into the problem we were 
                            studying through literature review. To my surprise, most of the mentoring programs for 
                            teens were in-person and provided by adults and professionals. Meanwhile, <strong>social media 
                            and private messaging platforms, which are potentially an accessible source of support 
                            for youth, hadn’t been well studied.</strong></p>
                        <p> Identifying the knowledge gap, we decided on 2 research questions we wanted to address:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> What are the topics/problems for which youth sought support? </li>
                            <li> What are the types of support they received via private messaging platforms? </li>
                        </ol>

                <p> In this project, we were authorized to utilize some resources from one of my mentors’ previous 
                    study: a codebook of support types and a dataset of over 500 Instagram conversations among 
                    teenagers (their identity and personal information was confidential). A secured web platform 
                    was set up for the access of the dataset. I went through the dataset and filtered out <strong>82 conversations</strong> that were relevant to our scope of study. The data coding process was executed on Microsoft Excel: I read every single conversation and coded them 
                    based on the support type codebook (<strong>what kind of support </strong> the participants 
                    used, <strong> how they comforted </strong> each other specifically with words and actions). Working on the data, 
                    I <strong> developed a new codebook </strong> for the conversations’ topics, or the problems participants were 
                    dealing with. </p>

                </div>
                <p> Throughout the coding process, I noted down some interesting pieces of information outside our scope of study that can 
                    give us more insights into the research results later on:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> How teens <strong> initiated peer support conversations </strong> (checking in, starting with casual conversations, etc) </li>
                    <li> The <strong> relationships </strong> between teens (friends, romantic partners, strangers, etc) </li>
                    <li> Teens' <strong> negative reaction </strong> to help seekers (refusing to help, blaming, etc) </li>
                    <li> Teens' negative reaction to help providers (rejecting help, disrespecting, etc) </li>
                    <li> <strong> Mutual support </strong> (roles of help seekers and help providers are interchangeable) </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 3. Data Analysis: Numbers in Qualitative Research </h2>
                <p> We used <strong> tables and charts </strong> to visualize our coded data, according to support types and subtypes, 
                    topics and subtopics. Besides, we analyzed the conversations based on categories such as: 
                    relevancy to the study, mutual support, whether mentees were happy and satisfied with the 
                    support, and so on. Having a mix of unarranged different charts and tables in hands, we faced 
                    a challenge as to <strong> how we could combine them into research results</strong>. This process was frustrating at 
                    first as we were overwhelmed with information, but once we eliminated the insignificant numbers 
                    and focused on the main categories, we were amazed at the findings we got. As the main research 
                    assistant to work with the data throughout the project, I found it interesting to <strong> step into 
                    the participants’ world, get to know their problems and sympathize with them</strong>. This is the 
                    first time I can understand the users’ stories from their perspective, instead of a researcher 
                    or designer’s point of view. I believe this is also an important part of UX research, in which researchers learn about their users with sympathy and compassion, and connect with them on a personal level.</p>

                <p> At the end of the summer, there was a summer showcase in which every STAR scholar had their 
                    poster hung up and presented about their research to the audience. I prepared a research 
                    poster for the on-campus fair and a video presentation for the virtual showcase. This is the 
                    time when I got a chance to reflect on what I had been doing over the summer, what I did well 
                    and what not. My mentors and I also wrote a paper based on our research findings and got it published at
                    the ACM CHI conference - the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
                    Although I wasn’t in charge of the writing process, it was a great opportunity for me to get involved in building an academic 
                    paper and understand how the process was going.</p>

                <p> This summer research's results have inspired us to work on a new project, studying <strong> young adults' needs and 
                    design requirements </strong> for effective online social support and support exchange systems. We are 
                    preparing to recruit research participants to conduct user surveys and interviews. Our end goal 
                    is to create <strong> a design solution that improves teens' experience with peer support.</strong> </p>

            <p id="cstudy-outro"> As a newbie researcher, I’m happy with what I have done throughout the program. 
                I got to learn more about research, an important branch in my major of study, and become 
                interested in it - which I have never considered the case as I’m more into the design track. 
                Moreover, I’m excited to continue with this project after the STAR program as I’m designing a 
                prototype for a digital platform that can improve teenagers’ experience with peer support.</p>
