                <p id="cstudy-time"> June - August 2022 </p>
                <p id="cstudy-intro"> The STAR (Students Tackling Advanced Research) Scholars Program marks some 
                    of my memorable first-times: my first job and my first academic research. This program of 
                    Pennoni Honors College, Drexel University, is an opportunity for first-year students to 
                    engage in an early faculty-mentored undergraduate research over the summer. I was honored 
                    to get accepted to the program and work on a research in my area of interest. <br>
                    I collaborated with two faculty professors to study what types of mental health problems are 
                    prevalent among teenagers and how they support each other emotionally on Instagram Direct 
                    Messaging. Our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581233" target="_blank">research paper</a> 
                    got accepted to be published at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 
                    in April, 2023. This research was also the groundwork for our current study on youth’s norms and
                    perspectives on effective peer mentoring (from September 2022 to the present). </p>

                <div id="star-wrapper1">
                    <p> I kicked off the project with secondary research - reading previous articles on the same 
                        research topic to gain insights into the problem we were studying. To be honest, I found 
                        it the most tedious part of the project, probably because academic reading didn’t draw me 
                        in and I have always preferred directly working with real data and information. However, 
                        I understood that literature review is still an indispensable step in the research and got 
                        along with the process. I reviewed around 10 papers and came to the conclusion that most of 
                        the mentoring programs for teens were in-person and provided by adults and professionals. 
                        Meanwhile, peer support occurring on social media, which is potentially an accessible support 
                        platform for youth, hadn’t been well studied. </p>

                <p> In this project, we were authorized to utilize some resources from one of my mentors’ previous 
                    study: a codebook of support types and a dataset of over 500 Instagram conversations among 
                    teenagers (their identity and personal information was confidential). A secured web platform 
                    was set up for the access of the dataset. I went through each conversation and coded them 
                    based on the support type codebook in an Excel file: what kind of support the participants 
                    used, how they comforted each other specifically with words and actions. Working on the data, 
                    I developed a new codebook for the conversations’ topics, or the problems participants were 
                    dealing with. This is also one of the two research questions we were seeking answers for. 
                    Throughout the coding process, I noted down some interesting pieces of information that can 
                    give us more insights into the research results later on.</p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 3. Data Analysis: Numbers in Qualitative Research </h2>
                <p> We used tables and charts to visualize our coded data, according to support types and subtypes, 
                    topics and subtopics. Besides, we analyzed the conversations based on categories such as: 
                    relevancy to the study, mutual support, whether mentees were happy and satisfied with the 
                    support, and so on. Having a mix of unarranged different charts and tables in hands, we faced 
                    a challenge as to how we could combine them into research results. This process was tiring at 
                    first as we were overwhelmed with information, but once we eliminated the insignificant numbers 
                    and focused on the main categories, we were amazed at the findings we got. As the main research 
                    assistant to work with the data throughout the project, I found it interesting to step into 
                    the participants’ world, get to know their problems and sympathize with them. This is the 
                    first time I can understand the users’ stories from their perspective, instead of a researcher 
                    or designer’s point of view.</p>

                <p> At the end of the summer, there was a summer showcase in which every STAR scholar had their 
                    poster hung up and presented about their research to the audience. I prepared a research 
                    poster for the on-campus fair and a video presentation for the virtual showcase. This is the 
                    time when I got a chance to reflect on what I had been doing over the summer, what I did well 
                    and what not. My mentors and I also wrote a paper based on our research findings and got it published at
                    the ACM CHI conference - the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
                    Although I wasn’t in charge of the writing process, it was a great opportunity for me to get involved in building an academic 
                    paper and understand how the process was going.</p>

            <p id="cstudy-outro"> As a newbie researcher, I’m happy with what I have done throughout the program. 
                I got to learn more about research, an important branch in my major of study, and become 
                interested in it - which I have never considered the case as I’m more into the design track. 
                Moreover, I’m excited to continue with this project after the STAR program as I’m designing a 
                prototype for a digital platform that can improve teenagers’ experience with peer support.</p>
