                    College, Drexel University marks some of my memorable first times: my first job and my first 
                    academic research. I collaborated with two faculty professors to study <strong>how teenagers support 
                    each other on Instagram Direct Messaging</strong> with the main role in <strong>directly coding 
                    and analyzing the provided data</strong>. Our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581233" target="_blank"><strong>research paper</strong></a> 
                    got accepted to be published at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 
                    in April, 2023. This research was also the groundwork for our current study on youth’s norms and
                    perspectives on effective peer mentoring. </p>

                        <p> Social media has become ubiquitous for adolescents and emerging
                            adults, where communication with peers happens online more frequently
                            than face-to-face. Therefore, they have also adopted it as a newer means for support seeking.</p>
                        <p> To my surprise, however, <strong>social media 
                            and private messaging platforms, a potential accessible source of support 
                            for youth, hadn’t been well studied.</strong></p>

                <p> At the start of the project, I was provided with the following resources: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A codebook of support types</strong>, listing the major types (and sub-types) of support exchanged in our social life (examined by a previous study)</li>
                    <li><strong>A dataset of over 500 Instagram conversations among teenagers</strong>: their identity and personal information were confidential. Data was stored in a secure web platform accessed only by researchers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> I decided to code the data on Microsoft Excel using Zero-One Integer Programming. </p>

                <p> Although data coding may sound rough and dry to a beginner like me, I still found the process 
                    enjoyable and insightful. With <strong>empathy and compassion</strong>, I felt like I could step 
                    into teenagers' world and observe their struggles as well as how they were going through them together 
                    - <strong>the real and "raw" user experience</strong> that I may not find by conducting user surveys or interviews.
                    I got to know and <strong>understand 
                    them on a personal level</strong>, rather than just from a researcher’s perspective.</p>
