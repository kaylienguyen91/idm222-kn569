                    <h1> Hello! </h1>
                    <p> I’m Kaylie Nguyen (or Diep Nguyen), a User Experience & Interaction Design student at Drexel 
                        University. I work as a UI/UX designer or researcher in my projects - these are also my two 
                    areas of interest that I desire to dive in and learn more about.</p>
                </div>
                <img id="personal-pic" src="portfolio-assets/personal-pic_tablet.jpg" alt="This is me!">
            </div>
            <p> What brought me to UI/UX design is how practical and beneficial it is in our daily lives. It’s a 
                creative process that is not only to create eye-catching and visually appealing designs but also 
                to solve people’s problems with digital products and bring them a better user experience. I love 
                it when I know that what I’m designing can benefit people and make their lives easier. 
                User-centered design approach acts as my guideline through every design and research project.
            </p>
            <p> As a college student, I aim to learn and explore as much as I can. Trying different positions in 
                design projects is one of my goals (including project manager and web developer), which teaches 
                me to be open-minded and look at the design process from different perspectives, as well as 
                collaborate effectively with other people in a team. Secondly, constantly learning and improving 
                my skills will stand me in a good stead in this everchanging field.
            </p>
            <p> Outside class, I have been working on a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research project about 
                mental health peer support among teenagers since June 2022. Our first research paper got published 
                at the ACM CHI 2023 - the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). 
                Currently we are continuing the project by preparing to conduct user interviews with young adults 
                in the area. The end goal of the project is to design a digital platform prototype assisting 
                teenagers in giving and receiving peer support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend some of my free time reading UX books and blogs, discuss with my mentor about my projects, 
                and refine my case studies. I’m reading “The User Experience Team of One” by Leah Buley and it’s 
                such an interesting book with insightful guide to UX!
            </p>
            <p> Beside designing, I enjoy going on picnics, taking a walk, reading and cooking. Recently I’m 
                taking up photography and learning French. Sometimes you may find me spending my whole day 
                exploring different neighborhoods in Philly!
