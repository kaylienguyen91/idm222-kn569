            <h1> Hello! </h1>
            <p> I’m Kaylie Nguyen (or Diep Nguyen), a User Experience & Interaction Design student at Drexel 
                University. I work as a UI/UX designer or researcher in my projects - these are also my two 
                areas of interest that I desire to dive in and learn more about.</p>
            <img id="personal-pic" src="portfolio-assets/personal-pic.jpg" alt="This is me!">
            <p> What brought me to UI/UX design is how practical and beneficial it is in our daily lives. It’s a 
                creative process that is not only to create eye-catching and visually appealing designs but also 
                to solve people’s problems with digital products and bring them a better user experience. I love 
                it when I know that what I’m designing can benefit people and make their lives easier. 
                User-centered design approach acts as my guideline through every design and research project.
            </p>
            <p> As a college student, I aim to learn and explore as much as I can. Trying different positions in 
                design projects is one of my goals (including project manager and web developer), which teaches 
                me to be open-minded and look at the design process from different perspectives, as well as 
                collaborate effectively with other people in a team. Secondly, constantly learning and improving 
                my skills will stand me in a good stead in this everchanging field.
            </p>
            <p> Currently I’m working on a project to design a digital platform prototype assisting teenagers 
                in mental health peer support. A related Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research has been done 
                over the summer, and now I’m conducting a UX research and brainstorming some ideas for the prototype.
            </p>
            <p> Beside designing, I enjoy going on picnics, taking a walk, reading and cooking. Recently I’m 
                taking up photography and learning French. Sometimes you may find me spending my whole day 
                exploring different neighborhoods in Philly!
