                    process of working with input and output data in the warehouse, which significantly shortened 
                    the process, minimized human errors, and increased workers' productivity. This experience also 
                    marked as my first time leading UX of a business with a fellow UX designer.</p>

                <p> Around 30k pounds of food is received and distributed from 9AM to 11AM everyday 
                    - a fast and chaotic process. And the real frustrations lied in working with the data. </p>

                <p> Sharing Excess (SE) has a mobile app for the company-wide internal workflow,
                    including the Wholesale section taking care of the Food Sourcing process. 
                    However, it didn't allow workers to record data in real time right in the warehouse, due to 
                    numerous shortcomings:</p>

                    <p class="callout-leftalign"> The SE app is not a well-functioning and optimal all-in platform, therefore users have to utilize an external platform to do their work.

                <p> After the Field Study with 3 Food Sourcing associates in warehouse, I still felt the need to have a more in-depth conversation with them to identify problems in detail and explore potential solutions. Thus, I set up a Focus Group and UX Workshop with all 3 workers: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Asked users to list every problem with the work process and the app, then order them in terms of priority and urgency.</li>
                    <li> Asked them to compare the pros and cons of SE app and Google Sheets </li>

                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 1. Put myself into users’ shoes</h3>
                <p>To solve complex problems of the app, I had to work closely with the users, and even build a relationship with them. User research is not only setting up an interview with people, but also “visiting” them and observing their frustrations in real life.</p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 2. Evaluate my design decisions from multiple perspectives</h3>
                <p> Every time testing my designs with the workers, I also handed them off to stakeholders and developers. They would let me know if the design was codable or if it might cause any problem.</p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 3. Take the initiative and Learn along the way</h3>
                <p> I was nervous to know that another intern and I would be the only designers of the company. I read more books, consulted other UX professionals, and self-studied to gain confidence. Thus I soon worked my way out and took control of the project.</p>                </p>
