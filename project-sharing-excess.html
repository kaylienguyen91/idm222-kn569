                    the process, minimized human errors, and increased workers' productivity.</strong> This experience also 
                    marked as my first time leading UX of a business with a fellow UX designer.</p>

                <p> Sharing Excess (SE) has a mobile app for the company-wide internal workflow,
                    including the <strong>Wholesale section</strong> taking care of the Food Sourcing process. 
                    However, it <strong>didn't allow workers to record data in real time</strong> right in the warehouse, due to 
                    numerous shortcomings:</p>

                <div class="se-problem">
                    <div>
                        <h3> 1. It lacks most of the important information</h3>
                        <p> The Entry form <strong>had no fills to enter important numbers</strong> such as case count and case weight. </p>
                        <p> &rArr; They put all these numbers into "Notes" fill </p>

                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 1. Put myself into users’ shoes</h3>
                <p>To solve complex problems of the app, I had to <strong>work closely with the users,</strong> and even build a relationship with them. User research is not only setting up an interview with people, but also <strong>“visiting” them and observing their frustrations in real life.</strong></p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 2. Evaluate my design decisions from multiple perspectives</h3>
                <p> Every time testing my designs with the workers, I also <strong>handed them off to stakeholders and developers.</strong> They would let me know <strong>if the design was codable or if it might cause any problem.</strong></p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 3. Take the initiative and Learn along the way</h3>
                <p> I was nervous to know that another intern and I would be the only designers of the company. I <strong>read more books, consulted other UX professionals, and self-studied</strong> to gain confidence. Thus I soon worked my way out and took control of the project.</p>                </p>
