                <p> Sharing Excess app (or SE app) is the company's main workspace platform, and also the main tool that workers use to record data of the food collecting and distributing processes. </p>
                <p> However, after conducting a Field Study and shadowing 3 Food Sourcing Associates through a typical workday in the warehouse, I concluded that <strong>SE app couldn't perform the most basic functions.</strong></p>

                <h2> <span class="sub-heading"> REFLECTION</span> <br>What I learned over the project</h2>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 1. Put myself into users’ shoes</h3>
                <p>To solve complex problems of the app, I had to work closely with the users, and even build a relationship with them. User research is not only setting up an interview with people, but also <strong>“visiting” them and observing their frustrations in real life.</strong></p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 2. Evaluate my design decisions from multiple perspectives</h3>
                <p> Every time testing my designs with the workers, I also handed them off to stakeholders and developers. They would let me know if the design was codable or if it might cause any problem.</p>
                <h3 class="margin-top-4rem"> 3. Take the initiative and Learn along the way</h3>
                <p> I was nervous to know that another intern and I would be the only designers of the company. I read more books, consulted other UX professionals, and self-studied to gain confidence. Thus I soon worked my way out and took control of the project.</p>                </p>
