                <p id="cstudy-intro"> This is another redesign project in my freshman year, but the difference 
                    is that this time I focused on the interaction more than the interface. I picked SoundCloud 
                    music streaming app, since I wanted to design a product outside the areas of restaurants, 
                    shopping or booking (which I already experimented with Ramen Bar’s website). As a SoundCloud 
                    user, I already identified some of its problems with interaction, thus I wanted to redesign 
                    it and visualize an ideal streaming app that can bring a wonderful experience to the users. </p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 1. Analysis and Planning </h2>
                <p> A redesign project always begins with an analysis of the original app. I created an app 
                    flow map illustrating the user’s journey when performing the app’s main user task: which 
                    button they hit first and then what’s next, what happens on the screen after each time 
                    pressing a button. Based on this flow, I evaluated SoundCloud’s interaction features as well 
                    as task flow: Does it take the users too many steps to complete the task? Are the 
                    microinteractions and animation smooth and “fun” enough to interest the users? The answers 
                    to these questions resulted in the project goals: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Redesigning the interface to help users perform the task faster and more easily </li>
                    <li> Adding more microinteractions and animations together with smoothing the transition between pages </li>
                </ul>

                <p> I conducted a card sorting exercise for the information architecture of the new app and got 
                    started with wireframes early on as they were the backbone for both interface and interaction 
                    design. I still followed the wireframing process that I’m used to: coming up with as many 
                    ideas as I could, asking people to do paper prototype and give feedback, refining and 
                    finalizing the sketches. I tried to be creative with the layout while still considering the 
                    best option to simplify the main user task, which was demonstrated in a new app flow.</p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 3. UI Design & Interaction Guides </h2>
                <p> Different from my previous redesign project, this time I wanted to create a completely new app 
                    with its own features, just relying on an existing app to avoid the design problems it has. 
                    Therefore, I built a rebranding plan for my music streaming app with potential brand names, 
                    a new logo, and a different style: half-modern half-retro. Bubbly is the result of my 
                    rebranding research.</p>

                </figure>
                <p> Although UI design wasn’t the main focus of the project, I still tried to put as much effort 
                    into it as it should get. I was struggling with colors this time. In the interface of a 
                    streaming app, there is a variety of colors coming from albums and songs’ images, thus the 
                    background color of the app has more responsibility for creating color contrast. At first, 
                    I chose a cream (or pale yellow) color for the background; however, it turned out not the 
                    perfect choice and a dark color would create way more contrast as I tested different tones. <br>
                    Next, I laid out an IX flow for the app with four parts: Trigger, Rules, Feedback, Loops & Modes. 
                    It acted as a detailed guideline for my interaction design later on.</p>

                <h2 class="cstudy-sec-name"> 4. Interaction Prototype </h2>
                <p> Before jumping into the most important phase of the project - interaction design, I sketched 
                    all the animations out on paper. More than just a task flow, my sketches visualized the desired 
                    microinteractions: How would this icon be bouncing and jumping around after I clicked on it? 
                    How long would the movement be? Would the icon’s design (color, size) change throughout the 
                    interaction?</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p> For this project, I didn’t create the interaction prototype on Figma but Adobe After Effects, 
                    which allowed me to design much more complicated animations. The process was hard at the 
                    beginning as it took some learning curves to understand the basics of After Effects. I was 
                    watching tutorials and working on my animation simultaneously. What took me the most time and 
                    effort to complete was the scrolling animation in the homepage. Other than a regular scrolling, 
                    I desired to animate how the content at the top of the page would move out of the screen and 
                    the new one would come in as the user scrolled down. This was a challenging but worthwhile 
                    process since I gained a lot of lessons after that.</p>

            <p id="cstudy-outro"> The end result of the project is the interface design of the app and an animation 
                video of the app prototype. Despite getting good feedback from my professor and classmates, I would 
                say there are still some flaws in my design. However, as the first time designing interaction, it 
                was still a valuable experience to me, and what I learned from it will set the base for my future 
                projects.</p>
