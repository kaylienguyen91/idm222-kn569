                <h2> Overview </h2>
                <p id="cstudy-intro"> I redesigned the header and navigation bar of the Figma Blog website by adding and 
                    improving their microinteractions. These new features better represented the Figma brand and made the 
                    website stand out from others, while also enhancing the website's user experience by adding joy and 
                    delight to each hover and click.</p>

                <h2> Context and Challenge </h2>
                <p> As a UX Designer, I love Figma not only for their product but also their informative blog posts 
                    about design and product industry. They even have a website dedicated to blogging. However, I 
                    already got a bad impression of the site right after looking at its header and navigation bar. 
                    They have some problems with microinteractions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The search bar, when activated, hides the navigation bar => This causes inconvenience while serves no purpose</li>
                    <li> The search icon and search bar don’t have smooth microinteraction or transition => aesthetically unpleasant</li>
                    <li> Headings on navigation bar didn’t have consistent microinteractions (one of them didn’t have microinteraction at all)</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Having been a big fan of Figma, I decided to help resolve these design problems by improving their existing microinteractions and visual interface. My design goals include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Smoothen the microinteraction of search bar and rearrange its position on the web page to avoid confusion</li>
                    <li> Standardize microinteractions of every heading on nav bar</li>
                    <li> Incorporate Figma’s branding and styling to increase brand identity and uniqueness</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
